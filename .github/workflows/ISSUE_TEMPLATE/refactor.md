## Checklist

- [ ] This refactor maintains backward compatibility with all user-facing APIs.
- [ ] For large-scale refactors, I’ve prepared a phased implementation plan.

## Current Limitations

Describe existing design flaws or technical debt:

**Example:** AEnvironment currently only supports limited sandbox engine integration.

## Proposed Refactor

Explain the improvement and its benefits:

**Example:** "Enhance sandbox engine abstraction to support pluggable backends including ASandbox, E2B, and Ray for better flexibility and performance across different deployment scenarios, enabling easier integration of new sandbox technologies and improved scalability across various use cases with consistent APIs across all engines."

## Alternatives Considered

Briefly summarize and compare other potential approaches (if applicable).

## Additional Context

Add references, screenshots, or related discussions.
